\chapter{FAQ}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Will you add a function to run it quietly/fully automatically/send results automatically in the background?} No, this would make it much easier to use it for malicious purposes and that's not a goal of this project. This way at least a 2nd targeted party has to make some actions which makes for some form of a consent I guess.
  \item \textbf{What is the actual goal of this project?} No idea. Fun? Gaining knowledge?
  \item \textbf{Why aren't you using a library for that thing? Why don't you use X or Y instead of Z, it's easier?} The goal of this project is to learn how things work under the hood. You won't learn using just ready-made tools.
