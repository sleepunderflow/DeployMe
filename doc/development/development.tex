\chapter{Development rules}
Suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Server can be done in python3 flask framework (I can provide hosting after we leave dev phase) (needs more research into the framework itself)
  \item  I'm still working on specs, If you have any idea let me know/add them to the docs
  \item Any suggestions? Say it
\end{itemize}
    
Suggested development rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item use Issues on GitHub
  \item keep docs up to date whenever you change something (if you don't want to play with LaTeX just leave a txt file describing changes, I can add it later)
  \item keep it nice and clean
  \item Make sure to periodically check documentations. Especially dev hints and specs
\end{itemize}
