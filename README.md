Suggestions:
- Server can be done in python3 flask framework (I can provide hosting after we leave dev phase) (needs more research into the framework itself)
- I'm still working on specs, If you have any idea let me know/add them to the docs
- Any suggestions? Say it

Dev suggested rules:
- use Issues
- keep docs up to date whenever you change something (if you don't want to play with LaTeX just leave a txt file describing changes, I can add it later)
- keep it nice and clean
- Make sure to periodically check documentations. Especially dev hints and specs
